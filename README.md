# OpenGL pseudo 3D-engine.

## Building

### Windows x64 (MinGW x64)

Just run `build.bat` and wait for creating `main.exe` file, then run it.

## TODO:
- **check Discord for other ideas.**
- ~~add .obj parser.~~
- ~~add universal Transform class, based on quaternoins for rotation (updating internal values on set with cache locking available).~~
- (removed) ~~rename methods Lock-/Unlock-Buffers to Lock-/Unlock-cache.~~
- ~~add surface local transform.~~
- upgrade ShaderProgram class.
